# Evolutionary Computing Simple Genetic Algorithm

An implementation a genetic algorithm and testing it on three functions which are defined over the binary domain. The goal is to find the binary vector that maximizes the function value; in each case the optimal value is the string of all ones:
* Counting Ones function 
* Trap Functions (tightly linked):
    * Deceptive Trap Function: k=4, d=1
    * Non-Deceptive Trap Function: k=4, d=2.5
* Trap Functions (randomly linked)

The goal is to check and get insight into the convergence behaviour of this GA.
